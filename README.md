## Description

The application is built using React Native, a framework for building cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript and React. 
It leverages the @react-navigation/native library for navigation and react-native-vector-icons for displaying icons. 
The app features a bottom tab navigator with four tabs: Home, My Cards, Statistics, and Settings. 
Each tab corresponds to a different screen component.
The application utilises React hooks (useState and useEffect) to control light and dark themes.
The base themes, DefaultTheme and DarkTheme from @react-navigation/native, are modified with extra colour changes (background and text) to fit the design of the application.
Utilising contemporary React Native methods to ensure cross-platform compatibility and performance, the application blends screen components, navigation, and theming to create a coherent mobile experience that gives users a fluid interface to switch between various functions and settings.
